# music-microservices

This is an on-going project. The idea is to get information about songs, artists, albums from Spotify and create a couple of microservices to integrate:
- OPA
- Kubernetes
- Istio
- Develop an iOS app to show the information
- Auth0
- Cloud K8S (AWS, GCloud, Azure)
- Terraform
- CircleCI
- Jenkins for local dev
- Shell scripting
- Standard security practices


For the microservice which fetches the data from spotify I am using Python
